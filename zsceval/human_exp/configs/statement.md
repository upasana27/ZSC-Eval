# Experimental Statement
## 1. Purpose
You have been asked to participate in a research study that studies human-AI coordination. We would like your permission to enroll you as a participant in this research study.

The instruments involved in the experiment are a computer screen and a keyboard. The experimental task consisted of playing  the computer game Overcooked and manipulating the keyboard to coordinate with the AI agent to cook and serve dishes.

## 2. Procedure
In this study, you should read the experimental instructions and ensure that you understand the experimental content. The whole experiment process lasts about **30** minutes, and the experiment is divided into the following steps:

(1) Read and sign the experimental statement, and you need to fill in a questionnaire；

(2) Test the experimental instrument, and adjust the seat height, sitting posture, and the distance between your eyes and the screen. Please ensure that you are in a comfortable sitting position during the experiment；

(3) You will first try out the game actions you learned in the tutorial within a simple layout to familiarize yourself with the game mechanics;

(4) Start the formal experiment. Please cooperate with the AI agents to get as much scores as possible. You will play with 7 agents in each layout and total 3 layouts. You need to rank the performance of these seven agents in each layout. After each round, we will ask you to add the current agent to the ranking. After the game ends in each layout, we need to confirm your ranking of the agents.

## 3. Risks and Discomforts
The only potential risk factor for this experiment is trace electron radiation from the computer. Relevant studies have shown that radiation from computers and related peripherals will not cause harm to the human body.

## 4. Costs
Each participant who completes the experiment and fills correct individual information will be paid 50 ~ 65 RMB according to your performance.

## 5. Confidentiality
The results of this study may be published in an academic journal/book or used for teaching purposes. However, your name or other identifiers will not be used in any publication or teaching materials without your specific permission. In addition, if photographs, audio tapes or videotapes were taken during the study that would identify you, then you must give special permission for their use.

I confirm that the purpose of the research, the study procedures and the possible risks and discomforts as well as potential benefits that I may experience have been explained to me. All my questions have been satisfactorily answered. I have read this consent form. Clicking the button below indicates my willingness to participate in this study


# 实验说明

## 目的

您被邀请参与一项研究人类与人工智能协作的研究。我们希望您能同意作为参与者加入这项研究。

实验中使用的设备包括电脑屏幕和键盘。实验任务是玩电脑游戏《胡闹厨房》，并使用键盘与AI代理协作烹饪和上菜。

## 实验流程

在本研究中，您需要阅读实验说明并确保理解实验内容。整个实验过程约持续**30**分钟，实验分为以下步骤：

(1) 阅读并签署实验说明，并填写人口统计信息；

(2) 测试实验设备，调整座椅高度、坐姿以及眼睛与屏幕之间的距离。请确保在实验过程中保持舒适的坐姿；

(3) 您将首先在一个简单布局中尝试您在教程中了解的游戏操作，并熟悉游戏机制；

(4) 开始正式实验。请与AI代理合作，尽可能获得高分。您将在每个布局中与7个代理进行游戏，共3个布局。您需要对这七个代理在每个布局中的表现进行排序。每轮结束后，我们将请您将当前代理加入排序。每个布局的游戏结束后，我们需要确认您对代理的排序。

## 风险和不适

本实验唯一可能的风险因素是来自计算机的微量电子辐射。相关研究表明，计算机及相关外设的辐射不会对人体造成伤害。

## 报酬

每位完成实验并正确填写个人信息的参与者将根据表现获得50至65元人民币的报酬。

## 实验数据保密性

本研究的结果可能会发表在学术期刊/书籍中或用于教学目的。然而，未经您的具体许可，您的姓名或其他识别信息不会在任何出版物或教学材料中使用。此外，如果在研究过程中拍摄了可能识别出您的照片、录音或录像，则必须获得您的特别许可才能使用。

我确认研究目的、研究程序、可能的风险和不适以及我可能体验到的潜在益处已向我解释清楚。我所有的问题都已得到满意的回答。我已阅读本同意书。点击下面的按钮表示我愿意参与本研究

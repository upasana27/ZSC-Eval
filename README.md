This repository is the official implementation of [ZSC-Eval: An Evaluation Toolkit and Benchmark for Multi-agent Zero-shot Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05208v2).

ZSC-Eval is a comprehensive and convenient evaluation toolkit and benchmark for zero-shot coordination (ZSC) algorithms, including partner candidates generation via behavior-preferring rewards, partners selection via Best-Response Diversity (BR-Div), and ZSC capability measurement via Best-Response Proximity (BR-Prox).

## üó∫Ô∏è Supported Environments

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Overcooked

[Overcooked](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai) is a simulation environment for reinforcement learning derived from the Overcooked! video game and popular for coordination problems.

The Overcooked environment features a two-player collaborative game structure with shared rewards, where each player assumes the role of a chef in a kitchen, working together to prepare and serve soup for a team reward.

We further include Overcooked games with multiple recipes, in which agents should decide the schedule of cooking different recipe for higher rewards.

### ‚öΩÔ∏è Google Research Football

[Google Research Football (GRF)](https://github.com/google-research/football) is a simulation environment for reinforcement learning based on the popular football video game.
We choose the Football *Academy 3 vs. 1 with Keeper* scenario and implement it as a ZSC challenge.

## üìù How to use ZSC-Eval for Evaluating ZSC Algorithms

After installation, here is the steps to use ZSC-Eval for evaluating the ZSC algorithms. We use the Overcooked Environment as an example.

```shell
cd zsceval/scripts/overcooked
```

### Setup the Policy Config

gen policy_config for each layout
```shell
bash shell/store_config.sh {layout}
#! modify the layout names
bash shell/mv_policy_config.sh
```

**An Example of policy_config**

[Policy Config Example](assets/policy_config.example)

### Prepare the Evaluation Partners

1. train behavior-preferring agents
```shell
bash shell/train_bias_agents.sh {layout}
```
2. extract agent models
```shell
cd ..
python extract_models/extract_bias_agents_models.py {layout}
python prep/gen_bias_agent_eval_yml.py {layout}
cd overcooked
```
3. evaluate the agents and get policy behaviors
```shell
bash shell/eval_bias_agents_events.sh {layout}
```
4. select evaluation partners and generate evaluation ymls
```shell
cd ..
python prep/select_bias_agent_br.py --env overcooked --layout {layout} --k 10 --N 1000000
```

Copy the results in `zsceval/scripts/prep/results/{layout}` to `zsceval/utils/bias_agent_vars.py`.

Generate benchmark yamls:

```shell
python prep/gen_bias_agent_benchmark_yml.py -l {layout}
```

5. train BRs for mid-level biased agents
```shell
cd overcooked
bash shell/train_bias_agents_br.bash {layout}
```

### Evaluate the ZSC Agents

We using the most common baseline, FCP, as an example.

1. evaluate S2 models
```shell
#! modify the exp names
bash shell/eval_with_bias_agents.sh {layout} fcp
```
2. compute final results
```shell
#! modify the exp names
cd ..
python eval/extract_results.py -a {algo} -l {layout}
```

## ‚öíÔ∏è How to Extend ZSC-Eval to New Environments

Firstly, the new environments should have consistent interfaces with those in [Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). Then **2 key steps** are required for generating evaluation partners:

- Design events that cover *common behaviors* in the new environment and implement event triggers for recording these events.
- Implement reward calculation using linear combinations of event records and event weights, and design weights that cover *common preferences* in the new environment.

We use GRF as an example to provide guidelines for including new environments in ZSC-Eval.

The GRF environment is integrated in `zsceval/envs/grf/`:

- `grf_env.py`: the environment wrapper to provide consistent interface with Gym.
- `scenarios/`: ZSC scenarios.
- **`reward_process.py`**: event-based reward shaping.
- **`stats_process.py`**: pre-defined events recording.
- `raw_feature_process.py`: observation processing for GRF, based on https://github.com/jidiai/GRF_MARL .
- `multiagentenv.py`: abstract interface

**`reward_process.py`** and **`stats_process.py`** are two key modifications to include GRF in ZSC-Eval.

We argue that ZSC focuses on high-level strategies instead of low-level operations, and thus use some common statistical variables as events, including:

```python
SHAPED_INFOS = [
    "pass",
    "actual_pass",
    "shot",
    "slide",
    "catch",
    "assist",
    "possession",
    "score",
]
```
`stats_process.py` implements triggers for each event and records the occurrence of these events, which is used in `reward_process.py`. `reward_process.py` receives user designated weights of the events, and competes the rewards that indicating behavior preferences using linear combinations. An example of a weights set is:

```shell
w0="[-5:0:1],0,[-5:0:1],0,[-5:0:1],0,0,[1:5]"
```

`w0` indicates `38` event weight vectors, under the constraints that each weight vector has at most `3` preferred behaviors (`3` non-zero weight), as shown in the following:

```plain
1: [-5.0, 0.0, -5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]

38: [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0]
```

The `38` weight vectors cover common preferences of football players in GRF, which is essential in evaluating ZSC capability.

Although the new environments may be complex, the triggers of events are relatively easy to implement and the high-level events and their weights are convenient to design. **We call for suggestions about new multi-agent ZSC environments and are happy to include them in ZSC-Eval**.
